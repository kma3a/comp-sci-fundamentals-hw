###Review Question Ch4 C++ for C programmers

1. In C++, the structure name, or _tag_name_, is a type.

2. Member funcions that are defined within class are implicitly _inline_.

3. A function invocation w1.print(); means that print is a _member_ function.

4. A private memeber (can or cannot)_can_ be used by a member function of that class.

5, The keyword _mutable_ allowes data members of class variables that have been declared const to remain modifiable.  Tis reduces the need to cast away constness using _const_cast_ <>.

6. The static modifier used in declaring a data memeber means that the data member is _independent of any given class variable_.

7. The preferred style is to have members or _public_ access first and members of _private_ access declared last in a class declaration.

8. A stack is a LIFO container. A conatianer is a data structure whose main purpose is _to store and retrive a larfe numbr of value_.

9. LIFO means _last-in-first-out_.
